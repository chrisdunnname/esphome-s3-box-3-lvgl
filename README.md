# ESP32-S3-Box-3-Custom LVGL Firmware 
ESP Home Configuration for the S3-Box-3 with an LVGL UI.

All credit and inspiration for the original UI goes to https://github.com/BigBobbas/ESP32-S3-Box3-Custom-ESPHome/

This firmware provides the S3 box with a template for voice assistant, timers, screen saver, analog clock, sleep, 12/24 hour time, media controls, radar sensing, temperature and humidity sensing, internal and external audio, and multiple pages for lights, thermostats, switches, media, scenes, locks and anything else you can think of.
